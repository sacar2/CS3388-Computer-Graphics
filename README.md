## Assignment 1
**Simple animation of rectangles using basic transformations**

640x640 window, black background, 15 inanimate rectangles (each of random colour, start position, initial orientation and dimensions)
Keyboard press ‘s’ begins the animation begins - rectangles rotate about their own centres along the z- axis, either clockwise or counter-clockwise (also selected randomly). Pressing ‘q’ on the keyboard exits the program.

## Assignment 2
**Implementation of a wiremesh renderer **

Vase rotated about z-axis and 2◦ angular increments of the given profile to form the discrete object boundary.

## Assignment 3
** Implementing a Curve Editor **

Implemented the functions to draw a Bezier curve, B- spline and Beta-spline curves. Right-clicking brings up a menu comprising of different types of curves: basic Bezier curve, cubic B-spline curve, Beta-spline curve, closed Beta-spline curve and cubic B-spline with phantom endpoints.

## Assignment 4
** Ray Tracing **

A ray tracer application. The scene contains three spheres of different sizes and colours, with ambient, diffuse and specular lights.
