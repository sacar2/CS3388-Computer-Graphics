From learning throughout this course and experimenting with different values of skew and tension parameters, I found that the shape of the curve drawn is affected. As tension increases, the curve gets closer to the knots/control points. By decreasing these values, the curve releases this tight pull, having the curve not as sharply or closely pulled to the knots as you decrease the tension value. This effectively “stretches” the curve out, rather than have it flatter and smoother. Changing the skew values are harder to describe. Skew in the blending curve pulls the curve towards the knots for certain points rather than others. This is because skew in a curve adds asymmetry. Both skew and tension parameters change the shape of the curve, mainly in the way they are pulled towards the knots. Comparing Cubic B Spline and Beta Spline curves, they both have a similar behaviour. Both use blending functions, implemented by the piece wise functions discussed in the course. Both curves are shaped closely by their control points towards knots. They differ in their blending function. Beta spline curve use the two parameters, skew and tension, as mentioned earlier, which change the shape of the curve directly. Having no tension and no skew (tension = 0, and skew = 1) in the Beta Spline equation, effectively reduces the Beta Spline into a B Spline. The skew and tension parameters gives more control over the curve, and are the differentiating factors between a Beta Spline and B Spline.
